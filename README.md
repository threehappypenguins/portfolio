# Portfolio Website

This project is a personal portfolio built with **Next.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It is fully front-end and serves as a space to showcase projects, experience, and contact information.

The application uses the Next.js App Router and a collection of custom components for layout, navigation, theming, and content display. All timeline and portfolio information is sourced from **`/data/portfolio-data.ts`**, which centralizes the project and experience data.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **PostCSS**
- **ESLint**

## Notes
This project is entirely client-side and does not include backend services. All assets and data are stored locally within the repository.
